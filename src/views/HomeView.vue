      This website is a work in progress, created to make learning music especially on string instruments easier and more enjoyable.
      This is the very first version. As I continue learning music myself, Iâ€™ll keep adding new features and content to make it more useful and helpful for others on their musical journey.
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope things you will find here will be helpful.
